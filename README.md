Hi, welcome to my (rarely-updated) page!

# Interests
I am interested in radiation protection, space-based R&D, ML applications, and general mathematical analysis. I also play around with informal interests, 
such as the NHL and Pokemon. 


# Professional Code
All of my production-level code is housed in my work-associated github (with all repositories hidden), so this page is just for my casual/fun/side-project work.


# Projects
Currently working on:

  - An A* algorithm for finding the best location for training within the Pokemon games.
  - Various ML-releated projects, including a custom k-means clustering algorithm, written character determination, and whatever else I come across.
  - A radiation protection project that has almost no code loaded here.
